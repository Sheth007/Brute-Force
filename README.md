# Brute-Force
Just a basic brute force attack script in python.

I use Pyautogui to enter passwords also used Foxit Pdf Reader to try infinite times.
You can also use any web browser and if you're using a web browser like chrome or edge then make sure enter the 
refresh time after 3 unsuccessful passwords.
I provided the both files for browser and with any pdf opener softwares.
and this below is with a pdf opener software demo.

Once you start the scirpt in and ide then open the pdf that I provided and open both side by side.
after few seconds of delay it will start entring the passwords one by one from passwords.txt file.
once the password is matched then file is open BUT theres a slight issue like if file opens then code does not stop, it will still entring the password.
so you have to stop MANUALLY.

THE PDF'S PASSWORD IS : abc@1234
